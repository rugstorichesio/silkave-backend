SILK AVE BACKEND INFORMATION

The Silk Ave game uses a simple backend API hosted on Render.com to store and retrieve leaderboard scores.

API ENDPOINTS:

1. GET https://silkave-backend.onrender.com/scores
   - Returns all scores in the leaderboard
   - No authentication required

2. POST https://silkave-backend.onrender.com/scores
   - Adds a new score to the leaderboard
   - This endpoint is only accessible through the game completion flow
   - Scores can only be submitted after completing all 10 cycles of the game
   - Required fields:
     * alias: Player name
     * btc: Final BTC amount (number)
     * glock: "Yes" or "No"
   - Optional fields:
     * date: Date of the game (YYYY-MM-DD)
     * hash: Game verification hash
     * gameHistory: JSON string of game actions

The backend automatically stores all submissions and makes them available to the leaderboard.
Scores are sorted by BTC amount (highest first) when displayed.

Note: The backend may take up to 30 seconds to "wake up" if it hasn't been used recently,
as it's hosted on a free tier that spins down after inactivity.
